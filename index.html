                    <p class="bio-body">After being in the construction industry for 3 years as a Heavy Civil construction contractor, I am looking to learn an entirely new skill and jump into a more technology driven indutry that promotes fast paced innovation. Within the construction industry, I've had the opportunity to develop a drone program with my company. Drones can be used to create 3D models of a site for quantity tracking purposes to use as backup for payment.</p>
                    <p>A few of the construction projects I've worked on include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Amtrak - King Street Station Improvements</li>
                            <li>BNSF - Kent/Orillia Yard Improvements</li>
                            <li>Sound Transit - Operations and Maintenance Facility: East</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>Outside of work, here are a few of my hobbies:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Music - Guitar, Vocals</li>
                            <li>Photography</li>
